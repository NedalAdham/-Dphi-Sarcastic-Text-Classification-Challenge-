- In this challenge, you will work on a dataset that contains news headlines - which are aimed to be written in a sarcastic manner by the news author. Our job here is to build our NLP models and predict whether the headline is sarcastic or not.




Evaluation Criteria:
- Submissions are evaluated using Accuracy Metric. 


How do we do it? 
- Once we release the data, anyone can download it, build a model, and make a submission. We give competitors a set of data (training data), with both the independent and dependent variables.We also release another set of data (test dataset) with just the independent variables, and we hide the dependent variable that corresponds with this set. You submit the predicted values of the dependent variable for this set and we compare it against the actual values. 

- The predictions are evaluated based on the evaluation metric defined in the datathon.
